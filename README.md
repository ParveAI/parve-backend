## Technologies Utilized

We have employed several technologies to build and maintain the Parve AI backend:

1. **Cloudflare Workers:** We leverage Cloudflare Workers as the backbone of our backend architecture, ensuring high availability and efficient routing.

2. **Supabase:** Supabase plays a vital role in managing our database operations, providing a robust and scalable solution for data storage and retrieval.

3. **PostgreSQL:** Our choice of database management system is PostgreSQL, known for its reliability and performance.

4. **Hono:** Hono serves as the web framework for our backend, enabling us to build and manage API endpoints efficiently.

5. **Edge Functions:** We make use of both Cloudflare's and Supabase's edge functions to optimize data processing and enhance the overall user experience.

By integrating these cutting-edge technologies, we aim to provide a seamless and responsive experience for Parve AI users while ensuring the security and reliability of our backend services.
